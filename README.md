`alea` is a public package inherited the spirits of previously private XENON likelihood definition and inference construction code `binference` that based on the blueice repo https://github.com/JelleAalbers/blueice. 

Binference was developed for XENON1T WIMP searches by Knut Dundas Morå, and for the first XENONnT results by Robert Hammann, Knut Dundas Morå and Tim Wolf.
